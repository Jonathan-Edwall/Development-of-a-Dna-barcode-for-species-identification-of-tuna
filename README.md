# Development-of-a-Dna-barcode-for-species-identification-of-tuna
This repository contains a python script for barcode gap plotting, as well as an example input-file for the script.
The script was developed for the student thesis "Development of a Dna barcode for species identification of tuna", which was a project I was a part of.
This project corresponded to my bachelor thesis for the Molecular Biotechnology Engineering Programme at Uppsala university.

By publishing this script on github I am hoping this script will come to use for anyone in need of it :)
If there is any needs to expand this script to work for other softwares than Mega 11, I am willing to help!
